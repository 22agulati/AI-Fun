# AI-Fun
Using some material from my class (CS 188) as well as some other python tools to explore NNs and other DL/AI concepts!

# Thing 1: CS 188 Homework 4 (Optional Coding)
Used Homework 4's optional coding work in order to explore the idea of the Viterbi algorithm along with how to use Bayes' nets and N-gram models to explore prediction of words and word generation.
