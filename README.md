# AI Fun
Using some material from my class (CS 188) as well as some other python tools to explore NNs and other DL/AI concepts!
The goal is to use this repo as a place to try to learn a variety of concepts by application. I've been very involved in theoretic ML and AI more recently
and now want to play around with the tools! The goal of this is as follows 
(1) Build a NN with Tensorflow in the context of a web app
(2) Explore some concepts of 231n and Stanford's NLP course
(3) Work on understanding a few of the Neural Net structures (RNNs, GANs, etc.)

## Thing 1: CS 188 Homework 4 (Optional Coding)
Used Homework 4's optional coding work in order to explore the idea of the Viterbi algorithm along with how to use Bayes' nets and N-gram models to explore prediction of words and word generation.
